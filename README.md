# IPL_Data_Analysis_Python
Problem Statement: We have consolidated the data for each of the player sold in the IPL 2022 auction and that of the reatained players from each franchise.

The data Contains information like-matches played, runs, wickets, average, strike rate, catches, runouts, stumps, etc.

Based on these data points - we will try to create the best 11 from these set of players from the current campaign. We can summarize our analysis in the following steps:

Extraction and loading the data.
Cleaning the data and removing the noise.
Analyze the data on different parameters.
Visualizing the important statistical findings.
Making the best team of 11 - based on the ICC world cup winning squad formation and last year's squad formation of the winning team in the IPL. i.e how many batters, bowlers and allrounders should be included in the team.
